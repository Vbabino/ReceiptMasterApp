# Receipt Master: Streamlining Your Expense Claims!

Receipt Master is a intuitive app designed to make expense claims as streamlined and effortless as possible.

The primary objective behind Receipt Master? Maximizing efficiency in expense claims. By automating a traditionally cumbersome process, I aim to save precious time for employees and finance teams alike.

Receipt Master endeavours to extract relevant details like date, VAT, and the total amount from your receipt. It also allows the user to edit or enter the relevant data manually.

Once you've reviewed your expenses, effortlessly share them through email, WhatsApp, iMessages, or any other platform with a tap. Our system packs a zip file for you with the receipt images and a handy csv file containing the relevant information.

Your finance team will then be able to upload the data from the csv file along with the receipt images to their accounting software, avoiding manual entries which could be prone to errors.

ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights:

ðŸ¤– Leveraging machine learning for automatic receipt categorisation.

ðŸ”„ Seamless sharing capabilities.

ðŸ“‚ Bundles receipts and data into a zip for easy accounting integration.

Receipt Master is available in the App Store now:
